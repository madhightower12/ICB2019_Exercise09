# Part One
# Load text file of two related variables from Excel or Text file
# Produce a scatter plot of the two variables 

# Part Two
# Generate two figures summarizing the data in 'data.txt'


# Barplot with the means of two populations

# Generate a scatterplot with all of the observations
# Use 'geom_jitter()' function to make observations easier to see
# What do the bar versus scatter plots tell us?
